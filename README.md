# boxscore-cli

A CLI boxscore generator.

The newspaper boxscore was basically a perfect way to aggregate data about a given day's games.

Nowadays, nobody reads physical papers anymore, but nerds still use command line interfaces; if there was ever a second-best place for a boxscore, it was a CLI.
